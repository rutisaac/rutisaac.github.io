           <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am <em>an active learner </em> with a keen interest in exploring diverse subjects, especially those related to technology, design, photography, and human behavior. With some background in computer science and graphic design, I am continuously fascinated by the ways in which technology shapes our world and am always eager to delve deeper into its intricacies.</p>
            <p>Aside from my technical pursuits, I also enjoy <em>writing and creating content</em> that inspires and informs others. Whether it's through sharing knowledge, sparking creativity, or offering insights, I strive to contribute positively to the world around me.</p>
